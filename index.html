      <h1>My Pets</h1>  <!--I organized all of the original content by putting them into separate sections by relevance and conciseness.-->

      <h2>Hover over the images!</h2>
          
      <h4>I have three different pets, and they are all my favorite for different reasons. I feed them and give them water every day, and even though it's a lot of work, they are totally worth it.</h4>

      <h2>Lula</h2>
      
      <h3>Dog</h3>
      <img src = "Puppy.jpg"> <!--I added a link to the image of Lula so that the image can be displayed on the webpage.-->
      <p>Lula's been my dog for two years, and she's really fun to play with.  I like to take her to the park.  Her favorite toy is an old tennis ball.</p>

      <h2>Slowpoke</h2>
      
      <h3>Turtle</h3>
      <img src = "Turtle.jpg"> <!--I added a link to the image of Slowpoke so that the image can be displayed on the webpage.-->
      <p>Slowpoke is my turtle.  I have had him for as long as I can remember, but he became mine for real when I turned 10 because I promised to take care of him.</p>

      <h2>Hamster</h2>
      
      <h3>Fish</h3>
      <img src = "Fish.jpg"> <!--I added a link to the image of Hamster so that the image can be displayed on the webpage.-->
      <p>Hamster is the name of my fish. I named him hamster because I wanted a hamster and not a fish, but I like him anyway.  He basically just swims around all day, but I still like him.</p>
